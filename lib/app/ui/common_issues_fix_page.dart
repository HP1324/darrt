Go to your phone's Settings > Apps > Darrt > Notifications, and make sure the relevant notification channels (like Reminders, Timers, etc.) have Sound and Vibration enabled.

You can usually tap on each notification category to adjust its behavior.''',

If notifications arrive late or not at all, it's often due to battery optimization restrictions.

ðŸ”§ Fix:
Go to Settings > Battery > Battery Optimization > Darrt, and set it to Not Optimized or Unrestricted. 

This allows the app to run in the background and send notifications without delay, especially important for timers or reminders.''',

Auto-backup may not work reliably if your device has poor internet connection or restricts background activity due to battery optimizations.

ðŸ”§ Fix:
You can always go to the app's settings and manually trigger a backup. It only takes a few seconds and ensures your data is safe. 

Also, consider disabling battery optimizations for Darrt to allow smoother auto-backup functionality.''',

Sometimes, ads may still appear after purchase due to the app not restarting properly or purchase data not being restored yet.

ðŸ”§ Fix:
- Please completely close and restart the app after purchasing to apply the changes.
- If you've reinstalled the app, tap the "Remove Ads" button again. This will show the purchase dialog where you'll see a "Restore Purchases" option.
- Tap Restore Purchases, and restart the app again.

If restore still doesnâ€™t work, make sure you're logged into the Play Store with the same account used during purchase.''',
